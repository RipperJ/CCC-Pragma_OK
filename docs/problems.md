### 初级题 2题必做 （基本算子单元的实现)

1.Fast Fourier transform 

  > Fast Fourier transform is an algorithm that computes the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of a sequence, or its inverse (IDFT). FFT rapidly computes transformations by factorizing the DFT matrix into a product of sparse (mostly zero) factors.

2.Sobel Filter
  > Sobel filter is widely used in image processing and computer vision, particularly within edge detection algorithms where it creates an image emphasising edges. Discrete differentiation operator computes an approximation of the gradient of the image intensity function.

### 中级题 3题选2 （已有参考代码的优化)

1.Sign of curve Secp256k1, Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm  

  > Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) is a variant of Digital Signature Algorithm which utilize elliptic curve cryptography.   
  > 
  > [**Details**](https://github.com/xupsh/ccc2021/tree/main/problems/ecdsa)

2.Prediction of SVM Model
  > SVM (Support Vector Machine) is a deep learning model to predict sample’s classification. Give an already trained SVM model, implement the associated prediction.
  >   
  > [**Details**](https://github.com/xupsh/ccc2021/tree/main/problems/svm)

3.Sort
  > Sort a list of input integers into a specific sequence (increase or decrease).
  > 
  > [**Details**](https://github.com/xupsh/ccc2021/tree/main/problems/sort)


### 高级题 3题选1（不提供参考代码，5月15日后发布评测细节）

1.Minimum Spanning Tree  
  > A minimum spanning tree is a subset of the edges of a weighted graph that connects all the vertices together. without any cycles and with the minimum possible total weight.
  >
  > [**Details**](https://github.com/xupsh/CCC2021/tree/main/problems/mst)

2.K-1 Coloring
  >The K-1 Coloring algorithm assigns a color to every node in the graph, trying to optimize for two objectives:  
  > - To make sure that every neighbor of a given node has a different color than the node itself. 
  > - To use as few colors as possible.
  >
  > [**Details**](https://github.com/xupsh/CCC2021/tree/main/problems/color)

3.Estimated Diameter
  > The diameter of a graph is the greatest distance between any pair of vertices. The estimated diameter problem tries to find a distance that is close to the graph diameter as much as possible.
